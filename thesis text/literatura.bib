health care is increasing daily thru different mobile app stores. But
within these capabilities the number of hacking attacks has also
increased, in particular into medical mobile applications. The security
vulnerabilities in medical mobile apps can be triggered by errors in
code, incorrect logic, poor design, among other parameters. This is
usually used by malicious attackers to steal or modify the users’
information. The aim of this research is to analyze the vulnerabilities
detected in mobile medical apps according to risk factor standards
defined by OWASP in 2014.},

  abstract   = {Despite slow adoption in the US, mobile payments are thede facto solution for hundreds of millions of users in China for everything from paying bills to riding buses, from sending virtual "Red Packets'' to buying money-market funds. In this paper, we use the theoretical lens of infrastructure to study users' interactions with ubiquitous mobile payment systems in China, focusing on Alipay and WeChat Pay, the two dominant apps on the market. Based on data from a survey (n=466) and follow-up interviews (n=12) with users in China, we describe the diverse usage patterns across physical, social, and digital ubiquity, and a series of challenges people face. Reflecting on the lessons we learned from the Chinese case -- in particular, problems and pitfalls -- we discuss some implications both for design and for policy. Our findings have important implications for other countries that have been moving towards greater adoption of mobile payments.},
