# Engineer's thesis

*Topic: Access control to a smartphone with a smartband*

In my thesis I created an Android app which utilizes a MiBand3 fitness tracker as a security token for accessing applications chosen by the user. My app uses data gathered by MiBand and step counter sensor of a smartphone to continuously analyze whether user is capable of monitoring their device. If app detects that user is sleeping or away from the device it starts blocking access to previously selected applications until the password is entered.
